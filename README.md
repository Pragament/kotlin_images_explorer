![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a5e0948-b439-438e-a100-e7c33a1f5d2c)

Kotlin Images Explorer is an open-source application designed to help users browse, search, and manage image collections efficiently. Built with Kotlin, it provides a modern, responsive interface and robust backend to handle image storage and retrieval.

## Features

- Browse and search images by tags, names, or metadata
- Upload and organize images into collections
- Responsive user interface
- RESTful API for backend communication
- User authentication and access control (if applicable)
- Extensible architecture for adding new features

## Project Overview for New Contributors

This section provides a high-level overview of the codebase to help new contributors get started quickly.

### Major Folders and Files

- **/src/**: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - **/main/**: Application entry point and core logic.
    - **/kotlin/**: Kotlin source files for backend logic (controllers, services, models).
    - **/resources/**: Configuration files (application.conf, logback.xml), static assets, and templates.
  - **/test/**: Unit and integration tests.
- **/frontend/**: (If present) Contains frontend code (e.g., React, Vue, or static HTML/JS).
- **/db/**: Database migration scripts and seed data.
- **build.gradle.kts** or **pom.xml**: Build configuration for Gradle or Maven.
- **README.md**: This file, with documentation and contribution guidelines.

### Architecture Overview

- **Backend**: Written in Kotlin, exposes a REST API for image operations (upload, search, etc.). Handles business logic, data validation, and communicates with the database.
- **Frontend**: (If present) Connects to the backend API to display images and handle user interactions.
- **Database**: Stores image metadata and user information. The backend interacts with the database using an ORM or direct SQL queries.
- **Interaction**: The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API. The backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kotlin_images_explorer-1.git
   cd kotlin_images_explorer-1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Make sure you have [JDK 11+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) installed.
   - If using Gradle:
     ```sh
     ./gradlew build
     ```
   - If using Maven:
     ```sh
     mvn install
     ```

3. **Set up the database**
   - Ensure you have a supported database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) running.
   - Update database configuration in `/src/main/resources/application.conf` or `.env` file.
   - Run migration scripts in `/db/` if necessary.

4. **Run the application**
   - With Gradle:
     ```sh
     ./gradlew run
     ```
   - With Maven:
     ```sh
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

5. **Access the app**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the configured port).

## Roadmap
